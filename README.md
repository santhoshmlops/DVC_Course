# Course Introduction

## Welcome!

In this course, we will teach you about Iterative's tools and how you can use them for data science and analytics. We will explore everything needed to adopt a collaborative, experiment-driven approach to machine learning projects.

We will cover topics including reproducibility, pipelines, data versioning, experiment management, metrics tracking, visualization, and collaboration on machine learning projects. Along the way, we will learn how to use various tools from Iterative's ecosystem, most prominently DVC and Studio.

This course was written primarily with data scientists in mind to introduce them to the concepts and reasoning of turning their prototypes into production-ready code. Software engineers and DevOps engineers may find this helpful in helping to bridge the gap between the software engineering and machine learning worlds.
What to expect?

The course is entirely free and without advertisements. You will be the proud owner of the Iterative Tools for Data Scientists and Analysts certification at the end of the course!

Learners generally take around 8 hours to complete this course.

## Course objectives

Upon completion of this course, you will have learned:

The principles behind conducting collaborative, experiment-driven machine learning projects
How to create an automated experiment pipeline
How to version data and models
How to conduct, analyze, and compare machine learning experiments
How to efficiently collaborate with teammates on machine learning projects

## Prerequisites
This course was designed to be accessible to everyone interested in data science. Therefore no in-depth prior knowledge is required. Nevertheless, understanding of the following concepts and technologies may prove useful throughout the course:

##  Nice to have:

Modeling
Python
Jupyter Notebooks
Bash
Git

These topics are not the main focus of the course and are not extensively covered. We will, however, provide references to external learning materials where possible. And we're available for help should you get stuck!
Course structure

### The course is divided into seven modules (or six if you exclude this introduction) that are subdivided into lessons. We will cover the following topics:

Course introduction: Aside from detailing the course setup, in this lesson, we will explore our role as data scientists in the ML development workflow. We will discuss challenges in collaborating on ML projects and how reproducibility is a crucial principle in overcoming those challenges.
Practices and tools for efficient collaboration: In this module, we will lay the groundwork for effective collaboration through best practices and tools for software engineering.
Pipelines automation & configuration: Here, we will transform a Jupyter Notebook into an automated ML pipeline. This pipeline will form the basis for our experiments throughout the rest of the course.
Versioning data & models: Now we're getting to the good stuff! In this module, we will learn how to version your data and models. We'll learn why versioning is important and how it works, as well as how to track changes and switch between different versions. Finally, we will address how to access your data.
Visualize metrics & compare experiments: With our pipeline in place and our datasets managed, we will dive into the analysis of experiments. We will discover how metrics and plots can help us compare models and find the best possible version. We will also explore how to use DVCLive in deep learning scenarios.
Experiments management and collaboration: This module takes us through the ins and outs of experiment management. We will learn to use dvc exp run and experiment workflows with DVC and Studio. Finally, we will learn how to collaborate with teammates in Studio.
Review and advanced topics and use cases: In this module, we will explore some advanced concepts with our tools. Specifically, we will learn how to create a model registry as well as how to run experiments in the Cloud with CML. Finally, we will discover how to manage parameters and manage experiments in Studio.

Each lesson includes written explanations and videos that cover the topic. We provide demos to put your newly acquired knowledge into practice!
